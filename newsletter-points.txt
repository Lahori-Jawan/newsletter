1) Email is All About Nesting Tables

 2) Due to the lack of standards support in email, it’s not possible to use divs, sections
 or articles — instead you have to use tables. Moreover, you need to use lots and lots of 
 nested tables because neither the colspan nor rowspan attributes are properly supported.

 3) Your best bet is to place every block of text into its own cell and apply inline 
 styling to that cell, for example

 <tr>
 <td style=“font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #666666;”>
   Text
 </td>
</tr>

 4) Creating the Content Area:

 First off, we’ll add some padding to the middle cell so that the table inside has some
 space around it, as per our design.

 5) Now we are going to add our two columns of content to Row 3. Because we want a ‘margin’
 in between these two cells, but margin isn’t supported, we’ll create a three-column table 
 with an empty cell between the two outer columns
